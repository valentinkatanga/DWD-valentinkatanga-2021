	  <h2>City Pop playlist</h2>

	  <p>City pop (シティ・ポップ, shitī poppu) is a loose category of Japanese pop music that emerged 
		  in the late 1970s and peaked in the 1980s. It was originally termed as an offshoot of Japan's 
		  Western-influenced "new music", but came to include a wide range of styles associated with the 
		  country's leisure class and nascent economic boom, such as AOR, soft rock, R&B, funk, and boogie. 
		  It was also identified with new technologies such as the Walkman, 
		  cars with built-in cassette decks and FM stereos, and various electronic musical instruments.</p>

	  <p>Somewhere between listening to Ryo Fukui’s Scenery and Herbie Hancock’s My Point of View, YouTube Music did me a solid. 
		  The service recommended I listen to Hiroshi Suzuki’s Cat, a five-track jazz fusion album released in 1975.</p>
